Even then, that free-to-play game will forever be included as an \"owned game.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the Web API claiming that free-to-play games are excluded by default, and may be included if specified, this isn't true and free-to-play games will ALWAYS be returned no matter what you try to tell the Web API. Trust me, I tried and `include_played_free_games` does literally nothing. Sadly there is no way to tell if any of the returned games are free-to-play with this API on it's own, so you'll either have to use another API to check, or keep track of all appIDs of free-to-play games.
